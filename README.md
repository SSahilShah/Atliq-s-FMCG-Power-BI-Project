## Problem Statement
The FMCG delivery company is a growing manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat,India. It is currently operational in three main cities of India. They plan to expand to other metro/tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

The company is currently facing an issue where some key customers did not renew their annual contracts due to service issues. It is suspected that some essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, leading to poor customer service. Management wants to address this issue before expanding to other cities and has requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ‘On-time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all customers on a daily basis to respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level, including ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and On-Time in Full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

## Task List
Peter Pandey is the data analyst in the supply chain team who joined recently. Imagine yourself as Peter Pandey and play the role of the new data analyst excited to build this dashboard and perform the following tasks:

1. Create the metrics according to the metrics list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting. You will be provided with the transcript of this business review meeting in the form of a comic.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.

## Some Major Insights
- All the Key Metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) are far behind the target.
- On average, orders are delayed 0.42 days from the agreed date of delivery.
- Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed stores have the highest orders and the most delays in product delivery.
- Questions to consider:
  - Is it because we are not estimating the right delivery date?
  - Is it because we are receiving more orders than expected?
- Ghee, curd, and butter products are the most delayed in delivery.
- There have been no noticeable improvements in any key metrics in the last few months.
- There is a huge gap in IF% for most customers. Is it due to less production?
